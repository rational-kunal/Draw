# Draw

Draw is a tool for manually drawing rectangles on the simulator, ideal for highlighting changed UI elements. Simply press "x" and start drawing.

Our team began adding screenshots to highlight UI changes made due to our PR. It seemed like a cool ideaâ€”I could showcase my work, and reviewers could easily see the UI changes. But it became a bottleneck when I had to change UI on different surfaces, requiring screenshots for each one. So much repetitive work!

That sparked the idea: What if we could draw a border to highlight views directly in the app?
And here we are.
